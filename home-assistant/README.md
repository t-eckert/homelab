# Home Assistant

I run [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) on a dedicated Raspberry Pi 4 using the Home Assistant ISO. I started off by running Home Assistant as part of my Kubernetes cluster, but moved it over to a dedicated device because running the full Home Assistant OS allows me to add [add-ons](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/).
