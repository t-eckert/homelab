# Ideation

A simple LLM (the machine is CPU) only that I can use for basic tasks. In particular, naming git commits. I have this idea for the workbench that enables Jupyter lab access to the workbench code and data. The code will be synced to the GitHub repo by a sync server I write. When it goes to push commits, those commits can be named by using a diff sent to the LLM.

I'd like to move my personal website and blog to run on the server. I can expose them using Tailscale funnel.

For the different applications I run, I'd like to alias them using DNS to `{name}.thomaseckert.dev`. So `homeassistant.thomaseckert.dev` and `uptimekuma.thomaseckert.dev`.

## Maybies...

[Accent](https://www.accent.reviews/) for local translation.

[ActivePieces](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces) for workflow automations. Not readily self-hostable...

Actual Budget is cool, but I am already using YNAB.
